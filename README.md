School Smart Eye 

Real-time monitoring of the emotional well-being of students at school (for example, bullying) and alerts to their parents if necessary.

About
Using a camera and facial and motion recognition, our solution monitors the emotional well-being of school-age students real-time and sends any critical alerts to their parents in situations including potential on-going bullying or natural disasters. All of the transactions are logged on a private blockchain, as if there needed to be a legal dispute, a tamper-proof record that is distributed to each stakeholder becomes critical.
